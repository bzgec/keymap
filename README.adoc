* 2021/01/23: stared to learn Colemak-DH wide angle mode
** stopped learning after two weeks

[NOTE]
====
I would guess that it is probably good to learn Colemak-DH,
but right now there is no default support for it and problem with slovenian letters, vim, AwesomeWm shortcuts... still persists.

=== Setup custom layout
. Copy custom layout: `cp xkb/symbols/si_colemak /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/`
. Change layout: `setxkbmap si_colemak`
. Revert back: `setxkbmap si` (or `us`...)

==== link:keymap.sh[]
You can also use the provided link:keymap.sh[] script:

. Copy custom layout: `sudo cp xkb/symbols/si_colemak /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/`
. Copy script: `mkdir -p ~/.config/keymap/ && cp keymap.sh ~/.config/keymap/`
. Run script to toggle between layouts: `~/.config/keymap/keymap.sh`

===== Usage
* Set "si" layout: `keymap.sh si`
* Set "si_colemak" layout: `keymap.sh si_colemak`
* Toggle between "si" and "si_colemak" layouts: `keymap.sh`
* Get current layout: `keymap.sh get`

** Define the behaviour of the decimal point key on the numpad. (More accurately,
imports such behaviour override from `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/kpdl`.): `include "kpdl(comma)"`
** Define how the 3rd level (the one with accented characters, the one I referred to as "AltGr")
is accessed. In this case, itâ€™s with the right Alt key.: `include "level3(ralt_switch)"`
